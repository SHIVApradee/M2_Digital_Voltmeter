# Requirements
## Features
* Digital output of several types.
* Speed of reading
* Accuracy of reading
## Research
* Referred many e-sources for the coding part of LCD.
## Key Features
* Measuring instruments that convert analog voltage signals into a digital or numeric readout.
## SWOT ANALYSIS OF THE PROJECT
### STRENGTH:
* A digital voltmeter gives good stability.
* Digital voltmeter has an automatic range selection.
* It provides a better resolution.
### WEAKNESS:
* The speed of operation is limited due to the digitizing circuit.
* Digital voltmeters are prone to damage if the voltage is too much increased beyond the limit.
### THREATS
* The most obvious threat are high voltage transients.
