# Requirements
## Features
* Digital output of several types.
* Speed of reading
* Accuracy of reading
## Research
* Referred many e-sources for the coding part of LCD.
## Key Features
* Measuring instruments that convert analog voltage signals into a digital or numeric readout.
## The 4W's and H 
### WHAT
* Voltmeter is an electrical measuring instrument used to measure the potential difference between two points.
### WHY
*  It is used to measure the voltage or the potential difference in volts in a circuit.
### WHO
* It is an testing instrument used by a electrical power testing purposes.
### WHEN
* Digital Voltmeter is widely used to check if there is power in the circuit, such as mains outlet. Knowing the voltage across a circuit, current can be calculated.
### HOW
* It measures the input voltage after converting the analog voltage to digital voltage and displays it in number format using a convertor.
## SWOT ANALYSIS OF THE PROJECT
### STRENGTH:
* A digital voltmeter gives good stability.
* Digital voltmeter has an automatic range selection.
* It provides a better resolution.
### WEAKNESS:
* The speed of operation is limited due to the digitizing circuit.
* Digital voltmeters are prone to damage if the voltage is too much increased beyond the limit.
### THREATS
* The most obvious threat are high voltage transients.
